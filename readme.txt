for the following scripts to run
install python 2.7 and pip (Python package installer manager)

next, install packages one by one using
pip install <package-name>

packages required :
json , csv , urllib , urlparse , httplib2

side note : (it might be the case where some of these packages might come
			by default installed. Just run the script in that case to see which ones are required.
			Python shell will tell you error if package does not exist)

Final step : 
run the 3 scripts accordingly from shell

pyton <script_name.py>

scripts are :
RoadWorks.py
TrafficIncidents.py
TrafficSpeedBands.py
